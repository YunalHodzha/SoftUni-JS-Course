                <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but
                    great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

        <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
            accomplishments toward
            organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. Individual
            commitment to
            a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
